// Minimum/Maximum Falling Path Sum

/*
You have been given an N*M matrix filled with integer numbers, find the maximum sum that can be
obtained from a path starting from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row.
From a cell in a row, you can move to another cell directly below that row, or diagonally below 
left or right. So from a particular cell (row, col), we can move in three directions i.e.
Down: (row+l, col)
Down left diagonal: (row+l, col-l)
Down right diagonal: (row+l, col+l)
